Future Directions
##################

Some concepts we aim to include in Function Fuse in future:

*   Serving stored nodes. Could interface with model serving platforms such 
    as `Ray Serve <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/index.html>`_, or 
    `ModelMesh <https://github.com/opendatahub-io/modelmesh>`_
    in `OpenDataHub <https://github.com/opendatahub-io>`_.
*   Backend for hyperparameter search using e.g. 
    `Optuna <https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_, or 
    `Ray Tune <https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html>`_.
