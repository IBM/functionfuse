Background Concepts
####################

*FunctionFuse* is designed to enable the reuse of a single frontend implementation
across any backend on diverse infrastructure without modification. While trying 
to maintain the simplest possible interfaces in both frontends and backends, we 
also have some extended options for implementing features of new *FunctionFuse* 
backends that are likely to be common across data science scenarios. We describe 
the reasoning behind the currently implemented features of *FunctionFuse* in 
this section.
